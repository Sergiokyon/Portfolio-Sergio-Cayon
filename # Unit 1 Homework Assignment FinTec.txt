# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Background

As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the FinTech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many FinTech companies create tools and technologies that are then used by other companies.

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how a FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:

* Select a Fintech domain that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that domain.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload your case study to your git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

## Instructions

### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting.

**Note:** We covered a number of FinTech domains in class this week. If you already have a company in mind that you want to research, skip ahead to Step 3.

* Payments/Billing

* Capital Investment

* Investment Management

* Wealth Management

* Enterprise Solutions

* Insurance (InsurTech)

* Mortgage/Real Estate

* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking

* Lending

* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

* Regulation Technology (RegTech)

* Open Banking

* Robo-advising

Remember that because FinTech is an evolving field, different FinTech reports may use different names and definitions for various domains and sectors (e.g., CB Insights, Investopedia, Accenture). In addition, you may come across lists of FinTech domains online that are either longer or shorter than the list above; there is no one comprehensive list.

### 2. Choose a company (or project) within  your chosen Fintech domain.

Use online research to identify the trends in your domain, and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if you chose Wealth Management, you may want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.

Your company could be:

* A new, emerging FinTech company that is doing well in a particular domain. Examples include Square, Plaid, Lemonade, RobinHood, and Coinbase.

* A large incumbent financial or technology company that is doing something interesting and new with technology. Examples include Goldman Sachs’ Marcus, JP Morgan’s JPMCoin, Facebook Libra, and Apple Card.

* A smaller start-up that is not yet wildly successful, but that you find promising and interesting. This may include a FinTech company in your local area or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.

### 3. Conduct your research, using the case study template as a guide.

We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or––if necessary––remove sections from the template to accommodate the information available about your company.

**Note** If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope of the project rather than on the company itself.

Case Study: Coinbase's Opportunities in Fintech Sector

Coinbase, a pioneer in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, has significantly expanded access to digital assets while creating financial inclusivity and new investment opportunities. While it provides a user-friendly platform for trading various digital assets, they have also expanded into areas such as institutional investment services through Coinbase Prime as well as staking services. Their main strengths lie in user friendliness, robust security measures, and compliance with regulatory standards.

Innovation and Challenges
Fintech innovation continues apace, and with it comes an array of disruptive players such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). Their introduction presents both companies and investors alike with unique competitive issues that must be navigated successfully in order to remain on top. DeFi ecosystem leaders such as Uniswap and SushiSwap are pushing back against Coinbase, cutting into their market share while at the same time contributing to its rapid development. Although Coinbase has set an excellent standard when it comes to security and compliance issues, which makes them reliable services, but that does not give it the freedom to rest on its laurels and become complacent in this space. Key to its future strategic plan is the incorporation of cutting-edge services. Customized crypto investment plans utilizing AI and robo-advisors could offer customized guidance to individual users. Furthermore, an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace would make a timely addition given their increasing popularity.

Future Recommendations and Conclusions
In order for Coinbase to remain at the forefront of technological innovations and navigate an increasingly decentralized financial landscape, it must incorporate more innovative solutions. AI-powered personalized investment plans could incorporate machine learning, real-time API data, blockchain, IPFS decentralized storage space for storage purposes as well as robust cybersecurity measures; NFT marketplaces would likewise rely on these technologies while IPFS provided decentralized storage as well as robust cybersecurity measures; these recommendations would keep Coinbase on the cutting-edge while meeting user needs simultaneously.
